        <p>Logo is perhaps most famous as the language used to program a robotic turtle. The turtle is physical or virtual, moving around a floor or a screen. As the turtle moves, it leaves a line along its path. A Logo program describes patterns of movement, usually instructing the turtle to draw a picture.</p>
